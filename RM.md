# Open Alert

The purpose of this project is creating simple user-friendly service for searching lost or missing people.

Nowadays technologies allow us to find a lot of people gone missing but that is not enough.
Many missing people can go to other cities or even states or countries and local, federal and international
police hands are tied by endless paperwork, jurisdiction and other bureaucratic
and administrative procedures. Because of that real actions are delayed for too long in the
situation when every second matters.

The project aim is spreading the word about missing people as quick as possible and making finding them as
natural as it takes. There are certain features that are planned to be implemented in this project to help
lost people come back home.

* Information spreading. All of us have seen posters with missing persons on the walls and poles. You may not believe 
it, but people working in this sphere say that these posters are one of the most efficient ways to actually find
missing missingPerson. Thousands of common people on the alert are still more efficient than modern technologies and
a few of specialists. Via using Open Alert with some sort of web-interface or mobile app we can make information 
spreading even faster!

* Photo face recognition. It is planned to implement face recognition in Open Alert project. Common users can make
photos of persons who seem to be in trouble and in case of any close match to real missing missingPerson
the information will be sent to the operators immediately. Medicine workers can make a photo of unidentified missingPerson 
without having to file tons of forms and papers. Just snap a photo like in any social network, and you may save 
someone's life!

* Geo-tags. Some people, especially the ones with Alzheimer's or some other mental decease, can go to other cities
where they used to live decades ago. Searching for them there can be tricky - even spreading information in social 
networks or messengers may not be quick and convenient enough. In Open Alert we will implement geo-tags features. 
The operator will simply fill in several locations where the missingPerson could go to, and the next moment people in these
locations will receive a notification and will be on alert!

# Technologies used

For now Open Alert is just a bunch of Spring Cloud services. The data sources used are MongoDB.
In future we are planning to make C++ OpenCV app to work with photos. Maybe there will be 
some web-UI written on vue.js and mobile apps.
